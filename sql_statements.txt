#retrieve all users who registered within the last 30 days
#DAY here refers I want to substract day(and not Hours or Month etc....)

    SELECT *
    FROM Users
    WHERE CreatedDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

#find people with emails ending with specific domain @example.com
this weird syntax (*)means count all rows including rowas with null values

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalUsers
    FROM Users
    WHERE Email LIKE '%@example.com';

#update user based on id

    UPDATE Users
    SET Email = 'example@test.com'
    WHERE UserId = 123;
